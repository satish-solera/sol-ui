Getting started with **solUI**.

## 1. Prerequisites

Our components are built on a Android stack. Make sure your project is running:


- **Expo / React Native** (Recommended)
- **Nativewind CSS**


## 2. Install Dependencies

Most components rely on `nativewind` for CSS and `react-native-vector-icons` for a Icons Library. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install nativewind react-native-vector-icons
```


## 3. Add a Component

That's it! You're ready to go.

1. Browse the [Components](/docs/components/badge).
2. Click on the component you want to use.
3. Copy the source code or install via sol CLI.
