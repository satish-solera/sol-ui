description: Use solUI for your mobile UI.

**solUI** is a collection of layout components designed to make your mobile apps feel alive.

Instead of fighting with boilerplate, you can copy and paste these components directly into your project. We've focused on the "hard parts"—the coordination of responsive layouts, and the subtle details that make a UI feel premium.

## Why solUI?

**solUI** aims to inject some playfulness and "wow" factor back into the mobile apps. We re-create high-end patterns found on award-winning mobile screens and package them into readable, copy-pasteable blocks that you can truly own.

- **Built for Speed**: Copy the code, paste it, and you're done. No heavy library wrappers.
- **Full Control**: Since the code lives in your project, you have total control over every animation and style.
