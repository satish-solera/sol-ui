Getting started with **solUI**.

## 1. Prerequisites

Our components are built on a Android stack. Make sure your project is running:

- **React**
- **Expo / React Native** (Recommended)
- **Nativewind CSS**


## 2. Install Dependencies

Most components rely on `nativewind` for CSS and a Icons Library. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install nativewind react-native-vector-icons
```


## 3. Add a Component

That's it! You're ready to go.

1. Browse the [Components](/docs/components).
2. Click on the component you want to use.
3. Copy the source code or install via Shadcn CLI.

## Common Questions

**Do I need a CLI?**
Not yet. We believe in providing the code first. A CLI is in the works to make adding components even faster, but manual copy-pasting gives you the best understanding of how things work.

**Can I use this with plain CSS?**
The components are deeply integrated with Tailwind CSS 4. While you could convert them, it's designed to work best within the Tailwind ecosystem.

**Is it free?**
Yes, **uselayouts** is open-source and free to use for both personal and commercial projects.
